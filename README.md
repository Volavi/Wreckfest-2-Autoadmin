# Wreckfest 2 AutoAdmin Tool

An automated administration tool for Wreckfest 2 dedicated server that handles track rotation, player management, and server messaging.

Still very WIP but plans are in motion to make this into a very flexible and powerful system for managing Wreckfest 2 Dedicated servers. 

Be prepeared for crashes and issues! I myself have been running this script within a .bat script that checks if it is running or not making sure that it restarts and runs with the Server window

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automated Track Rotation**: Randomized track selection (Sequential track selection is planned)
- **Player Management**: Automatic welcome messages for new players
- **OCR Integration**: Reads server console output using Tesseract OCR
- **Configurable Messages**: All strings customizable via JSON
- **Server Command Automation**: Handles race starts/ends automatically
- **Damage & Rules Control**: Adjusts server settings per track type

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.8+
   - Tesseract OCR installed ([Download here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki))
   - Wreckfest 2 dedicated server
  
2. **Download this repo or download ZIP from *Releases* -page**:

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Configure**:
   - Edit `config.json` to match your server preferences
   - Set your Tesseract path in config (placeholder as the default location):
     ```json
     "tesseract_installation_path": "C:\\Program Files\\Tesseract-OCR\\tesseract.exe"
     ```
      - **NOTE:** *Might also work if Tesseract is in PATH*

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

   Key configurable elements in `config.json`:
   ```json
   {
       "track_rotation": [],         // Your track configurations including: laps, bots, damage, etc...
       "banner_strings": {},         // "Banner" to be shown in chat after every race
                                     // Messages have character limit (128)
       "player_join_strings": {},    // Welcome messages
       "random_track_rotation": true // Rotation mode (does not work at the moment)
   }
   ```
## üöÄ Usage

   - Make sure that the Wrecfest 2 Dedicated server is running
   - Run the script within it's folder:
      ```bash
      python wreckfest_2_autoadmin.py
      ```
   The tool will:
   
     1. Automatically find your Wreckfest server window
     2. Begin monitoring console output
     3. Handle track rotations when races end
     4. Welcome new players with configurable messages

## ‚úÖ The Good
   
   ‚úî **Time-saving automation** - No manual track changes needed
   
   ‚úî **Fully configurable** - Adjust every message and setting via JSON
   
   ‚úî **OCR-based** - Works without server mods or special access
   
   ‚úî **Randomization** - Keeps gameplay fresh with random track selection

## ‚ùå The Bad (Current Limitations)

   ‚úñ **Requires stable connection** - High ping or unstable connection might hinder usage

   ‚úñ **OCR can be flaky** - Depends on clear console text visibility
   
   ‚úñ **Window must be visible and focused** - Needs the server window unobstructed
   
   ‚úñ **No voting system yet** - Currently placeholder in config (coming soon!)
   
   ‚úñ **Windows-only** - Currently optimized for Windows systems

## üîÆ Planned Features

  - Player voting system for track selection
  - Ability to change wether track selection is random or not
  - Randomised weather selection for tracks
  - Automatic (configurable) removal and addition of bots in relation to player count
  - Better error handling for OCR failures
  - Ability to add verbosity from config file via debug_mode
  - Web interface for remote administration
